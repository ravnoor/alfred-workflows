Call `qapps` and all apps excluding the ones you set in the `keep_alive` Workflow Environment Variable will quit. The Finder and Alfred (including Alfred Preferences) are added to the exclusion list by default, unless you set their `kill_` variables to `true`.

Use the exact application names as they present themselves to the system. To prevent multiple apps from quitting, separate their names with commas.

`qprocesses` will kill all processes, subject to the same `keep_alive` and `kill_` settings, meaning even things in the background that you donâ€™t see will be asked to quit.

The External Triggers allow to temporarily override which apps to keep alive by passing them as the argument.

Note both options *ask* the apps to exit (`SIGTERM`) instead of *telling* them (`SIGKILL`). If you need to force individual processes to terminate, use [ProcessControl](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/master/ProcessControl) instead.
