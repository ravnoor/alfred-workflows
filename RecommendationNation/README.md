A list of movies to watch or books to read becomes less useful as it grows. Eventually you forget why you added an item, meaning you no longer know if it’s no longer relevant or the one you should prioritise. `RecommendationNation` aims to mitigate that problem by saving the “why” together with the “what”.

All commands are accessed via the keyword `rec`.

`Add recommendation` will walk you through the process of adding a new item. “Reason” is optional.

`View recommendations` shows everything you’ve saved. ↵ on an item searches for it on a relevant website. For example, by default film recommendations open on [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/), while book recommendations will open on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/).

Several other options are available. ⌘↵ opens on a relevant site and deletes the recommendation from the list; ⌥↵ opens on a generic search site; ⌃↵ deletes the recommendation; ⇧↵ sends it to the top of the list.

`Edit recommendations` opens the list on your default text editor.

`Change default sites` allows you to pick different websites as your source for viewing the recommendations on the web. As an example, the choices for the “Film” category:

Your picks will modify the Workflow itself and be accessible via Workflow Environment Variables, meaning you’re not limited to the included choices. If there’s a website you believe I should add, do let me know.

To keep your list synced between machines, use the `recs_dir` Workflow Environment Variable to pick a custom save location.
