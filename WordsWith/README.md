Call `ww` to get a list of options for how to search for a particular word — `wws` for words starting with the query, `wwa` for words that have it anywhere, and `wwe` for words ending in it. Add a word to search for, and it’ll filter in real time.

Picking a word will then call Alfred with `define`, so you can see the meaning of it if you have that option enabled.
