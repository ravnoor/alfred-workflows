Clean clutter from URLs such as all sorts ofÂ [`utm_` variants](http://www.bytefive.com/blogs/understanding-utm_source-utm_medium-and-utm_campaign) and subdomains like `m.` for mobile sites.

Run `lc` and input a URL, or leave it blank to use your clipboard contents. Action it and a clean link will be copied to your clipboard and pasted to your frontmost app. If given a shotened URL, redirects will be followed before cleaning.
