Take screenshots with a keyboard shortcut and upload them directly to [imgur](https://imgur.com/). Will produce both a sound and a visual notification when done, and copy the resulting direct link to your clipboard.

You may also upload an image (or pdf — imgur supports it as an upload but converts to png) by picking the `Upload Screenshot` `File Action`.

`uploadscreenshotclipboard` will upload the image in your clipboard.

`recentscreenshots` will enumerate recently taken screenshots, ordered from the last. You can then open them in the browser to view (↵), delete (⌘↵), copy (⌥↵), or preview (⇧).
